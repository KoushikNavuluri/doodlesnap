# **App Name**: DoodleSnap

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allow users to upload images from their devices to the application.
- AI Doodle Transformation: Utilize the models/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview model, using API key AIzaSyBfsiPsbivx5ZnfsiaesRfzmJ_4WprdnZs to transform the uploaded photo into a whimsical journal entry, overlaying hand-sketched white doodles, arrows, labels, symbols, and handwritten-style comments while preserving faces.
- Doodle Style Customization: Allow users to specify style preferences or prompts, so that the AI tool can conditionally use that style as a hint.
- Image Display: Display the transformed, doodled image to the user, along with tools for optional refinements.
- Download Doodled Image: Allow users to download the final, doodled image to their device.
- User Authentication: Implement user profile login and authentication to save generated doodles, so only logged in users can see generated images.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to evoke a sense of whimsy and creativity.
- Background color: Light off-white (#F8F8FF) to resemble the color of journal paper.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#66CDAA) to provide contrast and highlight interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text.
- Use simple, hand-drawn style icons that match the aesthetic of the doodles.
- Employ a clean, spacious layout with a focus on image display and ease of navigation.
